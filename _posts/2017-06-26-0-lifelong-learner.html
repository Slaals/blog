  Have you ever heard someone saying something along the line of "I would love to know what you know!" or "If I could draw like you..." when he encounters a person excelling in his duty? Yes you have! And maybe you've said that one day, or two, or even many many times.
</p>

<p>
  We, as humans, often ignore the process to master something. When someone is an expert at what he does, we tend to see the present, <strong>the actual person who masters something</strong>, but we don't consider how this person achieved this level. "He's gifted" and that's why and only why he excels.
</p>

<p>
  That is wrong to think that way because you know what?! it's the best way to never accomplish anything. Why would you ever try to excel when you know you're not gifted?
</p>

<p>
  Let's break down something here. The idea of "being naturally gifted" is not wrong, it's the way we value this parameter that is dead wrong. We were not born with the same genetics, we didn't grow in the same environment, we didn't learn the same way... And so on, that's fine, it's life, you can do nothing about it. Some people will be better at doing this and others better at doing that. But I can tell you that, only by the strength of willpower you can achieve almost everything you dreamt of &mdash; considering your not a huge dreamer, eh. That's really easy by using the Internet, no excuses anymore.
</p>

<p>
  Another personal guess I want to address. I feel like the way we tend to think of "naturally gifted" is linked to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger Effect</a>. In fact, the Dunning-Kruger as nothing to do with what we perceive of others but overconfidence. I find a relation here, Dunning-Kruger effect is about overconfidence that comes from a lack of knowledge in a topic, thinking that mastering a topic is only about being naturally gifted is because of a lack of knowledge either. Have you ever noticed how novices and experts from the same field don't agree about who is best? Maybe it's because the novice only see the surface while the expert knows what's going on. One is mystifying what he perceives while the other one is understanding.

<h2>The point of this article series</h2>
<p>
  I'm starting this article series because I found myself, sometimes, despairing when I see someone being really good at something that I like and thinking about what I missed to be that good.
</p>

<p>
  This has to stop, instead of thinking too long about the "why", with this article series the point will be the "how" and the "do". In addition, I'll use this as a "learning diaries" that I will publish to inspire you and invite you to do the same.
</p>

<h2>It's about a topic and my experience in the learning process</h2>
<p>
  This article series will only be about topics that I chose to learn. I'll talk about what I learnt the past weeks, what I understood, the difficulties I had and what is the next step.
</p>

<p>
  The goal won't be to learn the surface but gaining deep insight on the choosen topic. You can expect some articles to be theoritical and a bit harsh. Obviously I don't want to lose your attention so I'll always make sure to be concise when I'll write about what I learnt.
</p>

<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>
  I'll organize this series as the following :
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Articles title will contain leading numbers such as A/B where A is a serie about a specific topic, and B the article number.
  </li>
  <li>
    The first article number will always be "0". This article will be about self-assessment according to the topic and defining the goal(s).
  </li>
  <li>
    Depending on the topic, a serie can last a year.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Last words before the beginning</h2>
<p>
  I talked about experts, however the goal will never be to be an expert. The point is only to make the first step in order to master a topic, which is the most important one as it demystifies in order to be the one who understands.
</p>
