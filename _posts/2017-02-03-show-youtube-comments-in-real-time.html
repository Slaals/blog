  Months ago I got an idea. I love to watch YouTube videos, there are awesome contents there, the channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Vsauce">VSauce</a> is one of the best in my opinion — a channel related to science and human science.
</p>

<p>
  What I really like about YouTube, is people ideas or observations. When someone notice something in a video or have an idea, he leaves a comment. When a video is popular, there are lots of comments, so some comments will probably remain unread, even if it is a relevant one. And sometimes funny comments.
</p>

<p>
  I got an idea that allows to see some comments while watching a video, it's simple : showing comments at a specific time on the top of the video. But it's obviously not all comments, it only shows comments that have a time marker such as "2:01" — two minutes and one second.
</p>

<p>
  Then, here is the Chrome extension that shows YouTube comments in real time : <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/comon-com/nfmkbcjacdnbdnedcbnmecdcedoijpna?hl=f">ComonCom</a>r
