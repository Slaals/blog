  The first topic of this article series will be Machine Learning, a wide one.
</p>

<p>
  I have a computer science degree, but my classes were more practical than thoeritical. I know how machines work but I've basic knowledge on maths, Machine Learning requires good maths skills.
</p>

<p>
  I chose Machine Learning as the first subject because it's kinda the future <i>(actually it's the present)</i> and because I've always dreamt of building an artificial intelligence (AI). Well, there is no method to build a true AI as we see in movies, that's what I wanted to do with my very limited knowledge back in time... A real naive eh!
</p>

<h2>BTW, I wont build HAL9000, yet</h2>
<p>
  The first goal of this serie will be to understand and be able to explain the maths behind Machine Learning. It probably won't cover every methods as I know there are some, so I will focus on the common ones.

<p>
  I made a video about Deep Learning months ago (it's in French).
